  <h1>Revert Reach — Building a Digital Home for Reverts</h1>
  <p class="lead">Designing a digital ecosystem that adapts as it grows.</p>

  <img class="case-image" alt="Revert Reach hero collage" src="images/RR_HP_mockup.png">

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Revert Reach came to us with a clear vision but evolving needs. They wanted a website that didn't just exist alongside their app — it needed to <em>represent</em> their growing ecosystem of products: <strong>Companion Connect, Minara AI, The Lantern, and the Revert Reach Shop</strong>. Initially imagined as a functional platform for users to access these tools directly, the concept later evolved into a <strong>promotional and informational site</strong> designed to inspire users to download the app.</p>
  <p>As the <strong>lead UI/UX designer</strong>, I was responsible for translating this evolving brand identity into a clear, intuitive, and emotionally resonant experience.</p>

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>Unlike Hiyd.ai, Revert Reach didn't start with a fixed direction. The brand's tone, structure, and even product priorities shifted throughout the process — which became both the main challenge and my biggest learning opportunity.</p>
  <p>Early layouts were built to function like a product dashboard. Midway through, the team realized they wanted to position the site as a storytelling hub — a place that celebrated their values and guided visitors toward the app. That meant reworking the <strong>information hierarchy</strong>, CTAs, and overall flow to serve a new purpose while preserving the clarity and consistency we'd already built.</p>

  <h2>Designing Through Change</h2>
  <p>To stay adaptable, I focused on creating <strong>modular sections</strong> that could flex with evolving needs: hero blocks for each sub-brand, scannable feature grids, and repeatable CTA components.</p>
  <p>The goal was to make every page feel distinct yet unified under the Revert Reach identity. I leaned on visual hierarchy, whitespace, and structured typography to balance storytelling with functionality. The product pages now feel cohesive, whether you're exploring Minara's AI tools or the Companion Connect tiers.</p>

  <h2>Tools & Iteration</h2>
  <p>This project was a constant collaboration between the design and strategy teams. I used <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Figma Make</strong> to prototype and test responsive layouts quickly, incorporating feedback in real time.</p>
  <p>To push creative boundaries, I also leveraged <strong>ChatGPT as a design assistant</strong> — testing different content flows, CTA placements, and phrasing options. It was my way of applying Shopify's "AI-builder mindset": using AI to extend design thinking, not automate it.</p>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>The final website became a <strong>promotional bridge</strong> connecting Revert Reach's brand story to its growing app ecosystem. It now serves as the visual anchor for their digital presence, giving each sub-brand a clear voice while tying them together through consistent design language. The project has since launched successfully, with the client thrilled by how cohesive and purposeful it feels.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Revert Reach taught me that good design is as much about <strong>adaptability</strong> as it is about structure. Working through shifting goals forced me to lead with curiosity rather than control — to ask better questions, anticipate change, and iterate without ego.</p>
